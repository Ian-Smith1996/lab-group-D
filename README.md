Lab 1 - Makefile Practice
This assignment covered the major steps of the C toolchain and their respective roles. Makefile recipes were developed to build specified targets, with substitution patterns applied to create flexible and reusable rules. The distinction between phony and regular targets was examined, along with the expression of target dependency relationships within recipes. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the make tool were analyzed. Command-line usage was practiced to reinforce these concepts, and a Makefile was produced to demonstrate their application.
